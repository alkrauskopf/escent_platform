	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionText">
		  To subscribe to our e-mail newsletters, should we offer them, you will need to provide your
		  e-mail address. You may also be asked for other information when you
		  complete the registration process on the Site.
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionTitle">
		  b. User Accounts
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionText">
	   	  In order to use certain features on the Site, including without limitation, chat rooms, message boards, and certain other Services and features of the Site, you will need to register and create a user account ("User Account"). There is no charge to create a User Account. 
		  <br/><br/>
		  You may also be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information and other information about yourself, such as your first and last name, date of birth, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. By providing us with personal information, you consent to our collection and storage of your information. We may collect and store the following personal information: 
		  <br/><br/>

		  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
			<li>
				financial, billing and transactional information, such as credit card or bank account numbers, used in connection with any transactions or other activities on the Site or the Services; 
				<br/><br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				user feedback, chats, correspondence through our Site and the Services, and correspondence sent to us;
				<br/><br/>
			</li>
			 
			<li>
				other supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to Escent Partners, we may conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law; or if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information confirming your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your information).
			</li>
		  </ul>

		  <br/><br/>
		      Your Name will be publicly available on the Internet while 
			  you participate in some Services, like chat rooms or message boards, so you should exercise discretion when using these Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose publicly in such Services. In some instances, you may choose to create a "Public Profile" that will be available to others on the Internet. Public Profiles are managed entirely by you, and you are solely responsible for your Public Profile's content. You are also responsible for maintaining and updating the registration information in your User Account with current and complete information. 
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionTitle">
			c. Special Promotions and Purchases
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionText">
	   	  To participate in some Services such as sweepstakes, contests and surveys ("Special Promotions"), or to make online purchases ("Purchases"), you will need to provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, and date of birth. Your information may be collected by Escent Partners or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor or a vendor or affiliate involved in, or providing services in connection with, a Special Promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase.
		  <br/><br/>
		  If you make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special 
		  Promotion on our Site or through our Services, Escent Partners will 
		  collect your personally identifiable information, and you are deemed 
		  to consent to us providing your information to third parties who provide 
		  certain services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer 
		  service, promotion or sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, 
		  as applicable. These third parties are prohibited from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our customers, unless you choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective privacy policies.
		  <br>
		  If you make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which Escent Partners is participating on a third party's Web site (or through some other means or medium), we will collect your information from the third party only if you opt-in to receive additional communications from us, or we are required to fulfill some function in relation to your activity (e.g., to send your order or deliver a prize).

	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionTitle">
		  d. Information Collected by Other Means or Media
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionText">
	   	  In some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information and other information about you through other means, directly or indirectly. For example, if you access any Co-Operative Project content, or purchase such content via your wireless carrier or through another third party, Escent Partners may collect information directly from you or through the third party. Likewise, if you use our software, or provide information to other companies who share information about their customers, we may collect additional information about you. In each of these cases, Escent Partners will apply this policy to any personally identifiable information. 

	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionTitle">
		  e. Information About Other People
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionText">
	   	  Some Co-Operative Project sites and Services may ask you to submit personally identifiable information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and other personally identifiable information if you purchase a gift and want to have it sent directly to the recipient. A record of that transaction will be maintained as allowed and/or required by law. 

	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionTitle">
		  f. Customer Service
	   </div>

	   <div class="subSectionText">

	   <div class="sectionTitle">
		  V. Special Notice Regarding Children Under 13
	   </div>

	   <div class="sectionText">
	   	  Escent Partners recognizes the sensitivity of personally identifiable information concerning children under the age of 13 and therefore provides this Special notice. Escent Partners is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding children, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), 15 U.S.C. § 6501, et seq. Except in limited circumstances allowed by COPPA, Escent Partners will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personally identifiable information from a child under 13 without first obtaining consent from that child's parent or legal guardian. 

		  <br/><br/>
		  If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 13, and your child would like to participate in certain Services for which COPPA requires your consent (and Escent Partners has chosen to make such Services available to children in this age group), your child will be prompted to print out a form for you to complete and mail in to Escent Partners. The form will list the information required from both parent/guardian and child, as well as the intended uses of the information. Escent Partners will only collect information that is reasonably necessary for your child to participate, and Escent Partners will not share your child's personally identifiable information with any third party (except for purposes of fulfillment by a third party that has agreed to protect the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy), unless you specifically consent, or as permitted by COPPA or other applicable law. You may also subsequently revoke your consent and request that your child's information be removed from Escent Partners' active list. Please refer to the form for instructions and further information. 

		  <br/><br/>
		  If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child
		  under the age of 13 has submitted his or her personally identifiable
		  information without your permission or consent, Escent Partners will
		  make reasonable efforts to remove the information from its active
		  list, at your request. To request the removal of your child's
		  information, please send an e-mail to
		  <a href="info@escentpartners.com">info@escentpartners.com</a>
		  and be sure to include in your message the same User Name and
		  password and/or e-mail address that your child submitted.
		  <br/><br/>
		  Escent Partners encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the Sites, the Services and the Internet generally.

Third parties who provide, or participate in, Services on Escent Partners sites are prohibited from using our customers' personally identifiable information for marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise using such information, unless you choose to opt in to marketing, sharing, or other uses by the third parties.

		  <br/><br/>
		  Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
		  <br/><br/>
		  Escent Partners will not share, sell, rent, or disclose any personally identifiable information that we have collected except as stated herein, including you personal telephone numbers, or in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent to disclose; 2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including by means of our Privacy Policy or on Site, or through the Service where you provided your information; 3) we are required by law, legal process, or court order to disclose; 4) disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or interference with, Escent Partners’s rights or property, other Co-Operative Project Web site users, or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have made. Escent Partners may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with law, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or our TOS, or to protect our sites, customers, or others.
		  <br/><br/>
		  Escent Partners reserves the right to retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce the TOS, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.
