		Faith At Work is a network made up of congregations, other organizations, and individuals who are coming together around mission and outreach priorities. As a result of registering with the network, organizations get an Network Page where they hold discussion on topics of interest and causes. It is through these Network Pages that Apps are made available to those who want them.
