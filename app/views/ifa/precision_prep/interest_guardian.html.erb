        Dear <%= @current_guardian.first_name %>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for asking about the after-school program at <%= @current_organization.name %> called <span style="font-weight:bold">Precision Prep</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following are the <%= @current_organization.short_name %> teachers that have been informed of your interest:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
        <% @current_organization.ifa_admins.each do |admin| %>
          <li style="margin-left: 10px;">
            <%= admin.full_name %>
          </li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <%=@current_student.first_name %> is participating in an in-school SAT/ACT preparation program using the tools and methods of
        <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="http://www.precisionschoolimprovement.com/?child_id=76&id=64" target="_blank">Precision School Improvement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the <span style="font-style:italic;">after-school</span> program is to give students, such as <%=@current_student.first_name %>, more time to work on their personalized plans to achieve SAT/ACT goals,
        and to provide you a means to visibly monitor progress toward these goals. The program involves SAT testing strategies.
        More important, the program involves students learning how to self-assess their personal learning needs in terms of SAT & ACT benchmarks, and helping each student master those needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you again for your interest in Precision Prep, <%= @current_guardian.first_name %>.  You will be contacted shortly regarding the program at <%= @current_organization.short_name %>.
      </p>
