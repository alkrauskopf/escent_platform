Several cautionary lessons are already emerging:</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>From the start, the fast pace of these killings and the constantly shifting crime scenes placed a huge strain on this investigation and the interagency task force that formed to conduct it. Tip lines set up after the first shootings could never keep up with the calls.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>&quot;We had no idea how many calls were coming through. The tip lines were always busy,&quot; says Capt. Nancy <span class=SpellE>Demme</span> with the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD), which took the lead in the investigation.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>In response, the Federal Bureau of Investigation offered to organize a 24-hour tip line out of its </span><st1:State><st1:place><span   style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#111111‘>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#111111‘> office. By the time the line shut down Monday, it had logged some 140,000 calls, requiring 75 agents to cover phones on one afternoon shift.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>&quot;What this case shows is that no department as all the resources, all the facts, all the expertise it takes to break such a case.

Bruce Blaire, who managed communications for the MCPD.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>Still, the investigation caught an early break in terms of communicating:The MCPD was nearing the end of an eight-year, $130 million upgrade of its communications, including mobile computers and a new voice radio system. The new radios had not yet been distributed to the force, so 130 were available to distribute to other federal and state agencies in the task force. It meant that all members of the task force were using compatible radios from the start.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>&quot;If these attacks had come three months earlier, the radio system would not have been ready. Three months later, and we would have already cut over to the new system and have had none to give out,&quot; says Sergeant Blaire.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>Few communities could do the same. Despite constant calls for &quot;interoperability&quot; since the 9/11 attacks, it‘s still rare for police departments to be able to communicate with one another, federal agents, or other first responders in a community.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>&quot;In virtually every major city and county in the United States, no interoperable communications systems exists to support police, fire departments, and county, state, and federal response personnel during a major emergency,&quot; concludes a new report sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, chaired by former <span class=SpellE>Sens</span>. Gary Hart of Colorado and Warren <span class=SpellE>Rudman</span> of New Hampshire. They recommended setting up 24-hour operations centers in each state to link local and federal databases.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>The lack of such a link is emerging as a key feature of the case.

Police welcomed the ability to use the news media to communicate with the snipers. But they didn‘t appreciate the constant speculation on the investigation, or the fact that outside experts  with no access to evidence  were releasing their own profiles. Police worried that witnesses may not have come forward with information in this case, because some TV profilers led them to believe the suspects would be white.</span></p>  <p style=‘line-height:12.0pt‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial; color:#111111‘>&quot;When the news media couldn‘t get a competent person to comment, they would go to people who were not,&quot; says Robert <span class=SpellE>Ressler</span>, a former FBI profiler who helped define the field of profiling.
