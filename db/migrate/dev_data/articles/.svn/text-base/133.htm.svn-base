Nurture is something we do that has a basis in our culture:how we teach children, how we organize study groups, how our family members listen to each other, how we make counseling insights available in personal relations, how we read the Bible and transmit the Gospel so that the grace of God is understood, believed and lived with gratitude. It is necessarily looking in upon ourselves. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>When we speak of nurture, invariably we have a typical middle class North American congregation in mind. And it is true that faith must be learned and practiced in that context more effectively than ever. The new church program of our denomination will be built around the kind of nurture we are able to develop for newcomers. It is our style of evangelism! The contextuality of the Gospel which theologians are writing about pertains to our culture as well as any other, and all the tools and insights available must serve the ministry of Christ through our churches implanted here. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>The importance of nurturing faith is precisely the reason we must reflect on the nature of the faith. As long as we think only of ourselves and our nearby ministries, we have failed to define the faith which gives people hope in life eternal and the making of a just world to the glory of God. Even the sad life of Warren Schmidt has a glimmer of redemption when the scope of his existence goes beyond Omaha. It is more significant than Jack Nicholson and his producer realize, probably, that the secret of lifes meaning breaks through to him from Africa. It is not just a charitable action that might save him, but the friendship gift of a child and a Catholic missionary on the other side of the world. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>I was present last October in Benin, West Africa, for the General Assembly of Cevaa, a mission organization based in France consisting of a community of churches in mission. Forty-seven churches are members of Cevaa, mostly from Africa, but some from the South Pacific and Europe. We were hosted by the Protestant Methodist Church of Benin at an agricultural training center in Porto Novo. Close to 3,000 people attended the opening worship service in the immense City of Grace Church, with six or seven robed choirs, several womens groups wrapped in identical colors, one of which was the pastors wives association. When the organ was silent, the drums and horns joined in. The solemnity of the communion service and the elegant dancing in procession for the offering were mass demonstrations of the love of Christ and the trust of his people in every adversity. Government officials, the Roman Catholic bishop, the All Africa Conference of Churches and delegates from around the world brought greetings of solidarity and respect. With all their problems of poverty, unemployment, persons living with AIDS, and desperate hoping for a safe and prosperous life, African Christians have a mature faith in Jesus Christ and the wisdom and inner peace of the Holy Spirit. They are puzzled by the loss of numbers and indifference in the churches of the North, which have a century of mission history and shared life in Christ with Africa.<br> <br> The agenda of the meeting dealt with strengthening ties between North and South, exchanging persons among the churches, ministries of cooperation in Europe, the role of women and youth in renewing the churches, wars maintained by mercenaries effecting large populations, foreign exploitation of diamonds, oil, gold, copper, lumber, laborers in a way that brings only suffering to the people. It was a hard-working meeting, punctuated with good preaching, bible study, prayer, and visits to distant parishes. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>Faith nurturing among Disciples means introducing people to a work that God is doing here and elsewhere to win hearts and save lives. The church in Africa has a gift for us in friendship, human understanding, graceful and joyous expression. The spirituality that we nurture in the congregation, so necessary to inner satisfaction and courage in the face of disappointments and even death, comes to us from the same source which binds us to African brothers and sisters. And it is frustrated in its purpose for our lives without them. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>Benin, formerly Dahomey, is a land of legendary kingdoms. At Ouidah, it was the door of no return for millions of other Africans defeated and sold to Portuguese, Danish, English, Dutch, French, and American slave traders for three hundred years. Today, we must stand with Africans and others against racism in forms that still cause death and destruction across the planet. Our unity with Africa is a bridging of a division symbolic of all human divisions and their offence to God. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>Disciples of Christ in Congo feel that we have abandoned them, because war has made it practically impossible to have mission personnel and visitors there in Kinshasa and Mbandaka. We have sent funds for the hospitals, the seminary, and church administration, and Art and Mapuka Mehaffey are still there. Bonganjalo Goba, our mission executive for Africa, was in Congo last September. But our local congregations and regions have not kept us aware of the church in Congo by prayer and outreach the way they might. Our new Disciples Mission Fund has eliminated the image of world mission and evangelism from the center of our mission giving. The Vision for the year 2020 desensitizes the word mission, because the work and calling of the church through the Common Global Ministries Board is largely overlooked. That is not our only kind of mission, nationally and regionally, but it gives the tone to all the rest, as Isaac Errett, Maria Butler Jameson and the others who organized our missionary organizations in the 1870s knew very well. </span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>Faith nurture is helping people discover and grow in the nature of faith. This means a spiritual foundation that is made up of an awareness of Gods mission which has found us in a wonderful way and knowing it is to be found throughout our world. It the conviction that God wills justice for the poor and love of the stranger in a radical way and reaches us where we are to stretch our hands as far as Africa. Did Warren Schmidt weep for regret or for joy? Maybe both. </span></p>  <p class=MsoNormal><a href="http://www.disciples.org/cm/D2contents.htm">http://www.disciples.org/cm/D2contents.htm</a></p>  </div>
