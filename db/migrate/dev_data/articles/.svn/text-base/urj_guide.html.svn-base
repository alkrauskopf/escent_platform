<p><b>Union for Reform Judaism‘s Nothing But Nets Campaign:A Congregational How-To Guide</b><br>

From <a href="http://www.urj.org" target="_blank">Union for Reform Judaism</a></p>

<p><b>What is the Nothing But Nets campaign?</b></p>
<p>Nothing But Nets is a global, grassroots campaign to save lives by preventing malaria, a leading killer of children in Africa. A $10 donation goes directly toward the purchase and distribution of an insecticide-treated family bed net.</p>
<p>The Reform Movement has joined the Nothing But Nets campaign, making a commitment to provide 50,000 nets to save lives. Linking with other Movement efforts to aid the victims of genocide in Darfur, Union for Reform Judaism contributions will be used to assist Sudanese refugees who have relocated to impoverished communities and refugee camps across the border in Uganda, the Central African Republic and Chad.</p>
<p><b>Malaria Kills</b></p>
<p>Malaria is preventable, but infects nearly 500 million people each year and kills more than one million of those who become infected. Ninety percent of deaths caused by malaria occur in Africa where the disease is a leading killer of children. Every 30 seconds a child dies from malaria. Children who are able to survive the disease are faced with physical and mental impairments, such as poor growth and development.</p>
<p>Moreover, every day 25 million pregnant African women risk severe illness and harm to their unborn children from a malaria infection. Malaria incapacitates people and keeps them from working while they recover or take care of sick children. Malaria keeps countries poor. In addition to the burden on the health system, malaria illness and death cost Africa $12 billion a year in lost productivity.</p>
<p><b>How YOU can SAVE A LIFE:</b></p>
<p>With your help, we can stop this deadly disease. Across North America congregations are raising awareness and funds to combat the spread of malaria through Nothing But Nets. From basketball tournaments to religious school lessons, from b’nai mitzvah projects to t-shirt sales, check out the inventive, imaginative ways that congregations are involving their community in this important initiative!

<p><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></p>
<b>Why should my synagogue get involved in this effort?</b><br>

<p>The moral test of any society is how it treats the most vulnerable of God’s children:the elderly and the ill, the widow and the orphan, and above all, the children. Global efforts call upon us to end extreme poverty. Taking action through Nothing But Nets allows us to follow our tradition that states that saving a single life is the equivalent of saving the entire world. Encourage your congregation to start or join a Netraiser team at <a href="http://www.urj.org/nets" target="_blank">www.urj.org/nets</a>.</p>
<b>How does my $10 donation get to Africa?</b><br>

<p>Nothing But Nets works with the Measles Initiative to distribute nets to families. The Measles Initiative is a long-term effort to control measles deaths that has successfully delivered more than 200 million vaccinations and other health services to sub-Saharan Africa. The Measles Initiative partners—the American Red Cross, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the United Nations Foundation—have expertise in accessing remote, hard-to-reach areas throughout Africa.</p>
<b>How do the bed nets save lives?</b><br>

<p>Bed nets work in two ways. They stop mosquitoes from biting during the night and spreading the disease, and the insecticide on the nets kills the mosquitoes when they land on them, stopping them from flying on to find their next victim. Bed nets can prevent malaria transmission by 50 percent.</p>
<b>Why should I donate money for nets and not vaccinations?</b><br>

<p>Bed nets, vaccinations, spraying efforts, and water treatment are all important tools. Nets are one of the most effective ways to prevent malaria and are an easy way for individuals to make a difference in combating this disease. At this time there is not a consistently effective malaria vaccine. The parasite Plasmodium, which carries the disease, changes rapidly and can become drug resistant.</p>
What other organizations are involved in the campaign?</p>
<p>United Nations Foundation, The People of The United Methodist Church, the National Basketball Association’s NBA Cares, and Sports Illustrated, VH1, the Union for Reform Judaism, the Mark J. Gordon Foundation, AOL Black Voices, Rotarians’ Action Group on Malaria, the Wasserman Foundation, and Major League Soccer’s MLS W.O.R.K.S.</p>
<p><b>How much of my donation goes to overhead for the campaign?</b></br>
<p>None. One-hundred percent of your donation goes directly toward the purchase, distribution, and education about the proper use of an insecticide-treated bed net.</p>

<p>The moral test of any society is how it treats the most vulnerable of God’s children:the elderly and the ill, the widow and the orphan, and above all, the children. Global efforts call upon us to end extreme poverty. In order to do so, the Union for Reform Judaism’s endorsed the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals and joined in the campaign to reverse the devastation of this global trend.</p>
<p>Adopting this resolution was an important first step, however, many are left wondering what we as individuals can do to make an impact on such an overwhelming crisis. While cynics may claim that an individual cannot save the world, Judaism urges us to try, reminding us that saving a single life is the equivalent of saving the entire world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Union for Reform Judaism is partnering in an effort to eradicate malaria. This disease infects nearly 500 million people each year, kills more than one million of those who become infected and is the leading killer of children in Africa. Further, malaria significantly burdens health care systems and costs approximately $12 billion a
year in lost productivity throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, it is preventable. When families use insecticide-treated bed nets, a protective barrier against mosquitoes that carry the disease is formed. One bed net can keep an entire family safe from malaria for up to four years for only $10.</p>
<p>Linking with other Movement efforts to aid the victims of genocide in Darfur, Union for Reform Judaism contributions are being used to assist refugees who have fled Sudan and have relocated to impoverished communities and refugee camps across the border in Uganda, the Central African Republic and Chad. The Union for Reform Judaism initiated the campaign with a contribution of the first $25,000 towards our goal of providing 50,000 nets, or $500,000 to the area.</p>
<p>At this critical time, when the vicissitudes of nature wreak havoc on the already desolate lives of the vulnerable refugees, we can make a difference. Make a donation. Start a ‘Netraiser’ fundraising team. Save a life – one net at a time, one family at a time. You can make a difference by visiting www.urj.org/nets</p>
