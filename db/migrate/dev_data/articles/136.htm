Perhaps it began sitting in an air raid shelter in England during World War II. I remember cowering under a blanket hugging a hot water bottle to my chest, feeling the racing of my heart against my ribs. Night after night our family would head underground, hating the darkness that signaled the sirens and carnage. I was very afraid a bomb would, as we used to say, have my name on it.</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>I was afraid for my daddy who was fighting in the war as an Air Force pilot. I was afraid for my mother, elder sister and me, feeling like sitting ducks as bombs pounded us. I believed in God, but I wondered if He cared whether we survived or not!</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>Fear comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes. It can sneak up on you unexpectedly like a terrorist, or with ominous warning signals like the drone of an airplane. Fear can even make you ill, causing heart attacks or fainting spells. I hate the sick feelings of fear. Fear can certainly be exaggerated by a vivid imagination. There is the fear of what your kids are up to out of sight  especially if they get home late after a date. There is the fear your children will marry ill-advisedly or will not marry at all. And there is the fear of losing your job, your savings or your health  even your faith!</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>There is the fear of not being liked or appreciated, affirmed or loved. There is the fear of failure, boredom, termination or bankruptcy. And if you are in ministry, there is always the fear of having to lead the women of the church when they really intimidate you or the fear of failure when you cant meet everyones expectations! Enough about fear  I fear I have made you afraid of it!</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>What can counter and overcome our fears? Another fear! The fear of God, the glorious realization that He is bigger than all of our phobias and fears. If we fear God, we have nothing else to fear. In fact, Jesus said as much. Dont fear him who can kill the body! Fear Him who has the power to cast both body and soul into hell (that is, God). The devil is the father of fear while God is the Father of faith.</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>Let me tell you how God has overcome many of my fears that have buried me in the past. First, I have always had a fear of being laughed at. As a child, I was really shy and used to blush all the time. Then I became a Christian who was expected to stand up and speak out and that took care of my selfconsciousness in a hurry. Second, I feared loneliness. I have spent a good part of many years being apart from my family, sometimes for months on end. So, I have had to learn to lean on Him first and not treat my husband like the Holy Spirit! Third, I have feared that my children would not make it with God. I had to learn to let that go and promise the Lord that I would go on with Him even if my kids didnt! Fourth, I have feared death. The fear of flying nearly grounded me as a speaker! How could I get on a plane in a total panic and then get off and start speaking about faith? I have experienced real victory in this area of my life, maybe because God gave me lots of practice. Amazingly, I just received my 100 thousand mile frequent flyer card for actual miles flown in one year!</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>In the end, it has been <i>faith</i> that has chased my fears away! Faith in a God big enough and near enough and powerful enough to teach me how to trust and not be afraid. This issue deals with this very issue! Thinking about this, I penned a poem  just for us! Enjoy! Maybe you would like to climb into it to make it a prayer of your own.</span></p>  <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>In His Love,<br> Jill Briscoe<br> Executive Editor</span></p>  <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style=‘mso-cellspacing:0in;  border:solid windowtext .5pt;mso-padding-alt:9.0pt 9.0pt 9.0pt 9.0pt‘>  <tr>   <td style=‘border:none;padding:9.0pt 9.0pt 9.0pt 9.0pt‘>   <p align=center style=‘text-align:center‘><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;   mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shape    id="_x0000_i1027" type="#_x0000_t75" alt="Fear Not" style=‘width:84.75pt;    height:17.25pt‘>    <v:imagedata src="./index_files/image003.gif" o:href="http://www.justbetweenus.org/5_03/fear_not.gif"/>   </v:shape><![endif]--><![if !vml]><img width=113 height=23   src="./index_files/image003.gif" alt="Fear Not" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"><![endif]></span></p>   <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>When   fear sees faith a-coming, when doubt sees truth displayed,<br>   The truth that is in Jesus how can we be dismayed?<br>   When tears are wept in secret, when sorrows night descends,<br>   Then faith in Jesus power our sorry soul defends.</span></p>   <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>When   we are busy drowning in a sea of sad despair,<br>   When those we love have hurt us and our soul needs Gods repair,<br>   When loneliness oer-whelms us with an ache that none can touch,<br>   And were crushed with disappointments and life is just too much.</span></p>   <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>When   danger threatens loved ones, when death stalks near to home,<br>   When war shall rise against us, when panics on the throne,<br>   Remind us of your promises, renew our hearts in grace,<br>   And help us live in righteousness and truth before your face.</span></p>   <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>So   Jesus be our comfort and remind us in your Word,<br>   That our small voice in the tempest incredibly is heard,<br>   In the heaven you inhabit, in the love land where you live,<br>   And you travel through the universe, your peace to us to give!</span></p>   <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>So   we wait now in this stillness that garrisons our soul,<br>   Yes, we wait with hands uplifted till you come and make us whole,<br>   So when faith sees fear a-coming to fill our hearts with dread,<br>   Oh Lord Jesus great and mighty, will you please kill fear dead!</span></p>   <p><span style=‘font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana‘>   Jill Briscoe  2003</span></p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  <p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>  <p class=MsoNormal><a href="http://www.justbetweenus.org/">www.justbetweenus.org</a></p>  </div>
