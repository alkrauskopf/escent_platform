<strong>Purim Masquerades and March Madness</strong>
<BR><BR>
We read the story of Purim as one of intrigue and hidden identities:King Ahashuerus doesn‘t know that Esther is a Jew, Haman doesn‘t know that Mordechai is Esther‘s cousin, and both Esther and Mordechai need to hatch a secret plan to save the Jews from Haman‘s evil plan. Because of the extremely melodramatic nature of the story, almost farcical in its numerous unlikely plot contrivances, there are serious questions whether it is historically true, or meant to be a fantasy, or a Jewish adaptation of a Babylonian pagan story. It is these questions that have led to our tradition of celebrating this holiday with whimsy, masquerading, and mad revelry. Our Sages have said that we should revel in the telling until we do not know the difference between blessing Mordechai or cursing Haman.

But beneath the merriment, there is a serious message. The story is a metaphor of the Jewish people‘s experience in the Diaspora:How, because of our separate identity, we were time and again viewed with suspicion as a people scattered among, and apart from, the rest of society, at the mercy of the whim of rulers who cannot understand how we can be loyal both to our tradition and the country. All too often this situation does not have a happy ending, but Purim is meant to affirm with joyous revelry the bright moments; to teach how God functions through us in the world when we decry and overcome the persecution of a life based on whim, and, through our actions, turn such existence on its head. We blot out Haman‘s name on one day with revelry and irreverence so that we can resume the rest of the year with renewed strength, seriousness, and inspiration from God, to take action to blot out evil, to engender tikkun olam, repair of our world.

We can take action this Purim to help blot out some current evil. Today, there are millions of people in Africa who, because of their identity, are living at the mercy of the whim of tyrants and disease &ndash; refugees in central Africa, not only fleeing the atrocities of genocide in Darfur and civil war in the Congo and Somalia, but then also subject to the ravages and misery of malaria. For them, the story is not fantasy. We can make a profound impact, family to family, one family at a time, to help them overcome some of that evil and survive.

As part of the global UN Foundation effort, the Union for Reform Judaism‘s Nothing But Nets campaign has pledged to buy at least 50,000 insecticide-treated bed nets to protect 50,000 families in central Africa from contracting malaria, and to help stem the spread of the disease. We are more than half way there! For just $10, you can provide a bed net and give the gift of life and hope to another family.

The Commission on Social Action has created this page to offer tangible ways for synagogues and families to put some social justice action into the merriment and masquerade of Purim celebrations this year, giving thanks as well that we can take action l‘taken et ha‘ olam &mdash; to help repair the world.
